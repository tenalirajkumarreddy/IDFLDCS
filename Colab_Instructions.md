# 📝 Instructions for Running the Secure Federated Learning Demo

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Google Colab:
1. **Upload the notebook**: 
   - Go to https://colab.research.google.com
   - Click "Upload" and select `Secure_Federated_Learning_Demo.ipynb`
   - Or use "File" → "Upload notebook"

2. **Install required packages** (run this in the first cell):
```python
!pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn cryptography numpy pandas
```

3. **Run all cells sequentially** - the notebook is designed to work step by step

### For Local Jupyter:
1. **Activate your virtual environment**:
```bash
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux  
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install Jupyter** (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

3. **Launch Jupyter**:
```bash
jupyter notebook Secure_Federated_Learning_Demo.ipynb
```

## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### Change Dataset:
```python
# Replace breast cancer with different medical dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes  # or load_heart_disease
data = load_diabetes()
```

### Adjust Privacy Levels:
```python
# Modify privacy configuration
privacy_configs = {
    'strict': {'epsilon': 0.01, 'delta': 1e-6},
    'moderate': {'epsilon': 1.0, 'delta': 1e-5}, 
    'relaxed': {'epsilon': 10.0, 'delta': 1e-4}
}
```

### Scale Number of Hospitals:
```python
# Change number of participating hospitals
clients = create_federated_clients(X_train, y_train, num_clients=10)
```

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives Achieved**

After running this notebook, viewers will understand:

✅ **Federated Learning Fundamentals**: How hospitals can collaborate without sharing data
✅ **Security Vulnerabilities**: What attacks are possible and how they work
✅ **Privacy Protection**: How differential privacy protects individual patients
✅ **Secure Transmission**: How secure aggregation protects parameter sharing
✅ **Tradeoff Analysis**: How to balance privacy, security, and model performance
✅ **Real-World Application**: How to deploy secure FL in healthcare settings

## 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

### Memory Issues:
```python
# Reduce dataset size if running on limited memory
X_train = X_train[:1000]  # Use smaller subset
y_train = y_train[:1000]
```

### Installation Problems:
```python
# Alternative package installation
!pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install tensorflow==2.15.0 scikit-learn==1.3.0
```

### Slow Execution:
```python
# Reduce training rounds for faster demo
num_rounds = 3  # Instead of 5
local_epochs = 2  # Instead of 3
```

## 🏆 **Success Metrics**

The demo is successful when you see:
- ✅ All security stages complete without errors
- ✅ Attack success rates decrease across stages  
- ✅ Model accuracy remains above 90%
- ✅ Comprehensive security comparison charts
- ✅ Clear privacy-utility tradeoff analysis

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all packages are installed correctly
2. Ensure you're running cells in sequential order
3. Restart kernel and run all if needed
4. Verify virtual environment is activated (for local runs)
