### üîí Security Configurations You Can Try:

```python
# High Security (Slower but Very Secure)
high_security = SecurityConfig(
    differential_privacy_epsilon=0.1,    # Strong privacy
    byzantine_tolerance=0.4,             # High attack tolerance
    encryption_enabled=True,             # Full encryption
    signature_verification=True,         # Authentication
    intrusion_detection_threshold=1.5    # Sensitive detection
)

# Balanced (Recommended for Most Cases)
balanced = SecurityConfig(
    differential_privacy_epsilon=1.0,
    byzantine_tolerance=0.3,
    encryption_enabled=True,
    signature_verification=True,
    intrusion_detection_threshold=2.0
)

# Performance Focused (Faster but Less Secure)
performance = SecurityConfig(
    differential_privacy_epsilon=5.0,    # Weaker privacy
    byzantine_tolerance=0.2,
    encryption_enabled=False,            # No encryption
    signature_verification=False,        # No signatures
    intrusion_detection_threshold=3.0
)
