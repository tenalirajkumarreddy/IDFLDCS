# Intrusion Detection through Federated Learning in Distributed Cybersecurity Systems

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** using **Federated Learning (FL)** in **Distributed Cybersecurity Systems**.  
The aim is to build privacy-preserving, distributed, and scalable IDS models that detect malicious activities without centralizing sensitive data.  

We will proceed step by step, starting from **basics of cybersecurity** to **implementing FL-based IDS**, and finally identifying **research gaps**.
